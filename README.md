# Neuroplasticity and Cognitive Rehabilitation: Exploring Functional Connectivity Changes in Traumatic Brain Injury Patients

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and analysis used in the study titled **"Neuroplasticity and Cognitive Rehabilitation: Exploring Functional Connectivity Changes in Traumatic Brain Injury Patients"**. The study explores the relationship between neuroplasticity and cognitive rehabilitation in TBI patients, focusing on changes in brain connectivity as measured by EEG and their correlation with cognitive improvements.

## Data
The data used for the analysis consists of:
1. **TBI Age Data**: Provides TBI data categorized by age group, injury mechanism, and type.
2. **TBI Military Data**: Contains TBI data for military personnel categorized by service component, severity, and year.
3. **TBI Year Data**: Offers TBI data over the years based on the injury mechanism and type.

## Machine Learning
The analysis includes:
- Predictive modeling using Random Forest to predict trends based on TBI severity and injury mechanisms.
- Visualizations to understand trends in TBI cases and their impact on different groups.

## Figures
- **Figure 1**: Number of TBI cases by injury mechanism over the years.
- **Figure 2**: TBI severity trends in military personnel.

## Setup and Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
